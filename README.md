About:
This is a high-fidelity prototype for a gig-economy platform that combines parts of Uber and Kijiji into one. It allows users to post jobs for which they require help and don't want to pay full price. Jobs belong to certain categories which the skilled individuals (helprs) can bid an hourly or flat rate. Bids are consolidated in a message tab where the user requesting help can look at the different rates individuals are offering, and accept, counter or reject a bid from within the chat for a particular user. When fully implemented, helpr will reveal the job location shortly before the job is scheduled to protect the user's privacy in case they choose to cancel prior to job start, albeit at the loss of the down payment. It will also process payments via Swipe and feature year-to-date tax information for helprs.
